## Purpose
Understanding that mitigating bias demands a multifaceted strategy anchored in data-driven methodologies, the proposed solution hinges on the creation and utilization of a meticulously curated dataset enriched with labeled information on diverse articles, revealing their inherent biases. This dataset serves as the foundation for this initiative. Central to the deployed strategy was the development and deployment of a robust multinomial regression algorithm. This advanced algorithmic framework is designed to predict and classify the bias categories of unseen articles with speed. Its predictive capabilities, powered by a wealth of annotated data, can help in taking a step in the direction of mitigating bias within the online sphere.

## Problem Statement
The objective of the project centers on the optimization of a multinomial regression model tailored for predicting bias in online articles. This model operates on a dataset comprising crucial columns, topic, source, bias_score, and paragraph_vectors (reflecting article content), each numerically encoded and normalized.
